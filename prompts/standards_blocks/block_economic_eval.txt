ECONOMIC EVALUATION:

Provide economic analysis for each equivalent standard:

1. Material cost comparison:
   - Typical cost range for materials (per kg or per ton)
   - Cost differences between ГОСТ, GB, EN materials
   - Impact of safety factors on material quantity

2. Manufacturing cost:
   - Complexity of manufacturing
   - Special requirements (heat treatment, NDT, etc.)
   - Labor costs in different regions
   - Equipment requirements

3. Availability and lead times:
   - Availability from suppliers
   - Lead times for materials
   - Lead times for finished products
   - Import/export considerations

4. Testing and certification costs:
   - NDT costs
   - Hydrostatic testing costs
   - Certification costs (local authorities)
   - Documentation costs

5. Total cost of ownership:
   - Initial cost
   - Installation costs
   - Maintenance costs
   - Replacement costs
   - Lifecycle costs

6. Economic recommendations:
   - Most cost-effective option
   - Trade-offs between cost and quality
   - Long-term vs short-term cost considerations
   - Risk-adjusted cost analysis

NOTE: This block increases processing time. Use only when cost is a critical factor.
