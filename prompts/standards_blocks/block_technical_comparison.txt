TECHNICAL COMPARISON:

Provide detailed technical comparison including:

1. Pressure class equivalence:
   - Convert between МПа and bar (1 bar = 0.1 МПа)
   - Compare pressure ratings (PN in ГОСТ/GB vs PN in EN)
   - Note: Same PN number doesn't always mean same pressure!

2. Dimensional compatibility:
   - DN is nominally same across all systems
   - BUT actual dimensions (bolt circles, flange faces) may differ
   - Check compatibility tables for each DN size

3. Temperature ranges:
   - Operating temperature limits
   - Material temperature limits
   - Thermal expansion considerations

4. Design approaches and calculation methods:
   - ГОСТ: based on strength theory
   - GB: similar to ГОСТ (Soviet heritage)
   - EN: based on European standards (different approach)

5. Safety factors comparison:
   - ГОСТ: typically 1.5-2.6
   - GB: similar to ГОСТ
   - EN: typically 2.4-3.0
   - Impact on wall thickness and weight
