SAFETY ANALYSIS:

Analyze safety factors and requirements:

1. Safety factors comparison:
   - ГОСТ: typically 1.5-2.6 depending on material and conditions
   - GB: similar to ГОСТ (1.5-2.6)
   - EN: typically 2.4-3.0 (more conservative)

2. Impact on design:
   - Wall thickness differences (can be 15-25% due to safety factors)
   - Pressure rating differences
   - Temperature rating differences
   - Weight and cost differences

3. Failure modes analysis:
   - What happens if wrong standard is used?
   - Overstress scenarios
   - Leakage scenarios
   - Catastrophic failure scenarios

4. Safety recommendations:
   - When replacement is safe (e.g., ГОСТ → GB often OK)
   - When additional analysis is required (e.g., ГОСТ → EN)
   - When replacement is NOT recommended (e.g., lower safety factor)
   - When expert consultation is mandatory

5. Regulatory compliance:
   - Local regulations (Russia, China, Europe)
   - Industry-specific requirements (oil & gas, nuclear, etc.)
   - Certification requirements

CRITICAL: Safety must NEVER be compromised for cost or convenience!
