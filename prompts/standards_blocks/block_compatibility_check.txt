COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS:

For each pair (ГОСТ↔GB, ГОСТ↔EN, GB↔EN), evaluate:

1. Physical interchange:
   - Can you physically replace one with another?
   - Check bolt circles, flange faces, actual dimensions
   - Check gasket grooves and sealing surfaces
   - Result: "COMPATIBLE", "PARTIALLY_COMPATIBLE", "REQUIRES_VERIFICATION", or "INCOMPATIBLE"

2. Functional equivalence:
   - Do they serve the same purpose?
   - Are performance characteristics similar?
   - Can they handle same P and T?
   - Result: "YES", "CLOSE", or "DIFFERENT"

3. Risk level:
   - What is the risk of replacement?
   - Consider safety, reliability, compliance
   - Consider failure consequences
   - Result: "low", "medium", "high", or "critical"

4. Recommendations:
   - When replacement is acceptable
   - When additional verification is needed
   - When replacement is NOT recommended

IMPORTANT: 
- ГОСТ and GB are often compatible (GB based on Soviet standards)
- ГОСТ and EN often have different dimensions even with same DN
- GB and EN usually require verification
