TECHNICAL ACCURACY VALIDATION (weight: {weight}%):

Verify the following:

1. Standard codes are correct and current:
   - Check if standard codes exist
   - Check if standards are current (not obsolete)
   - Check if standard codes match the descriptions

2. Technical parameters are accurately represented:
   - Pressure ratings (PN, bar, МПа)
   - Temperature ranges
   - Dimensional parameters (DN, etc.)
   - Material specifications

3. Calculations are compatible:
   - Pressure calculations
   - Stress calculations
   - Temperature derating
   - Safety factor applications

4. Design approaches are similar:
   - Calculation methods
   - Design philosophies
   - Assumptions and limitations

5. Formulas and methods are equivalent:
   - Check if formulas produce similar results
   - Check if methods are compatible
   - Identify significant differences

SCORING:
- 90-100: Excellent technical accuracy, no significant errors
- 70-89: Good accuracy, minor discrepancies
- 50-69: Acceptable accuracy, some errors or gaps
- 0-49: Poor accuracy, significant errors

Provide score: ___/100
Provide justification for the score.
