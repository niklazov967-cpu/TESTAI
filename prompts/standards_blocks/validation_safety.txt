SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS VALIDATION (weight: {weight}%):

Verify the following:

1. Safety factors are adequate:
   - Compare safety factors between systems
   - Check if replacement maintains adequate safety margin
   - Identify any reduction in safety

2. Failure modes are considered:
   - Overpressure failure
   - Temperature excursion failure
   - Fatigue failure
   - Corrosion failure
   - Brittle fracture

3. Operating limits are compatible:
   - Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP)
   - Maximum allowable working temperature (MAWT)
   - Minimum design metal temperature (MDMT)
   - Cyclic loading limits

4. Emergency scenarios are addressed:
   - Overpressure protection
   - Fire scenarios
   - External impact
   - Seismic events

5. Safety recommendations:
   - When replacement is safe
   - When additional safety analysis is required
   - When replacement is NOT safe
   - When expert consultation is mandatory

CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:
- NEVER compromise safety for cost or convenience
- NEVER use lower safety factor standard as replacement
- ALWAYS consider worst-case scenarios
- ALWAYS err on the side of caution

SCORING:
- 90-100: Excellent safety, no concerns
- 70-89: Good safety, minor concerns addressed
- 50-69: Acceptable safety, additional analysis required
- 0-49: Safety concerns, replacement NOT recommended

Provide score: ___/100
Provide justification for the score.
