DIMENSIONAL COMPATIBILITY VALIDATION (weight: {weight}%):

Verify the following:

1. DN sizes are truly compatible:
   - Same DN number doesn't always mean same dimensions
   - Check if bolt circles match
   - Check if flange faces match
   - Check if gasket dimensions match

2. Can parts be physically interchanged?:
   - Bolt hole patterns
   - Bolt hole diameters
   - Flange thickness
   - Hub dimensions
   - Sealing surfaces

3. Are there any dimensional mismatches?:
   - Identify specific mismatches
   - Assess impact of mismatches
   - Determine if adapters are needed

4. Common compatibility issues:
   - ГОСТ and EN have different bolt circles even with same DN
   - GB is often compatible with ГОСТ (based on Soviet standards)
   - EN dimensions often differ from both ГОСТ and GB
   - Metric vs metric (but different actual sizes)

5. Verification recommendations:
   - When dimensional drawings are required
   - When physical mockup is recommended
   - When expert consultation is mandatory

SCORING:
- 90-100: Fully compatible, direct interchange possible
- 70-89: Compatible with verification, minor adjustments may be needed
- 50-69: Partially compatible, adapters or modifications required
- 0-49: Incompatible, replacement not recommended

Provide score: ___/100
Provide justification for the score.
List specific dimensional concerns.
