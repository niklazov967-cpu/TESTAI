APPLY 10-STAGE METHODOLOGY:

Follow these stages from the research:
1. Identify requirements - determine standard type and application conditions
2. Analyze functional purpose - operating conditions (P, T, environment)
3. Compare technical parameters - calculation formulas, safety factors
4. Check dimensional compatibility - all metric, but actual dimensions may differ
5. Evaluate materials - cross-reference steel grades between systems
6. Analyze testing methods - NDT, hydrostatic tests, certification
7. Check availability - availability from suppliers
8. Legal compliance check - compliance with local regulations
9. Economic evaluation - cost of materials and manufacturing
10. Decision making - documentation and approval of replacement

Apply each stage sequentially and document findings for each stage.
