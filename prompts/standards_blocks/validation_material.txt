MATERIAL EQUIVALENCE VALIDATION (weight: {weight}%):

Verify the following:

1. Material grades are correctly cross-referenced:
   - Check if proposed material equivalents are accurate
   - Verify chemical composition compatibility
   - Verify mechanical properties compatibility

2. Mechanical properties are similar:
   - Yield strength (σт / ReH) - within ±10%?
   - Tensile strength (σв / Rm) - within ±10%?
   - Elongation (δ / A) - within ±15%?
   - Impact energy (KCV / KV) - within ±20%?

3. Chemical compositions are compatible:
   - Carbon content - similar?
   - Alloying elements - similar?
   - Impurities (P, S) - within limits?
   - Special elements (Cr, Ni, Mo) - compatible?

4. Heat treatment requirements are similar:
   - Annealing, normalizing, quenching, tempering
   - Temperature ranges
   - Cooling rates
   - Final microstructure

5. Common material equivalence issues:
   - Similar names don't always mean equivalent properties
   - Different manufacturing processes affect properties
   - Different quality control standards
   - Different traceability requirements

SCORING:
- 90-100: Excellent equivalence, materials are interchangeable
- 70-89: Good equivalence, minor differences acceptable
- 50-69: Approximate equivalence, verification required
- 0-49: Poor equivalence, materials are NOT equivalent

Provide score: ___/100
Provide justification for the score.
List specific material concerns.
